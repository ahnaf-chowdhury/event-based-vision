# msc-event-based-vision

This repository contains some python notebooks that were used during my MSc project. The files "pydvs_dataset.ipynb", "MVSEC_dataset.ipynb" and "IBM_gesture_analysis.ipynb" include the analyses on these three datasets including visualisation and the measurement of metrics.

The "IBM_gesture_dataset_lighting.ipynb" file generates results to be used for the investigation of the effect of lighting condition on event rate. It stores results from each sequence along with information on the subject and lighting condition. These results were used in the file "alexander_govern.ipynb" to perform Alexander-Govern statistical test in order to investigate the effect of lighting condition on event rate.

The "corner_detection.ipynb" file comprises the analysis on corner detection, and the "investigation_on_interval_length_on_pydvs_dataset.ipynb" contains the investigation of the effect of interval length of metrics of interest in the transmission of event-based data.
